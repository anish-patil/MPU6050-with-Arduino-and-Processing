## Description about MPU6050


The MPU-6050 is a commonly used Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor. It is a small electronic device that consists of a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope, which measure the acceleration and angular velocity of an object in real-time.
The accelerometer measures the acceleration of the sensor in three dimensions (x, y, and z), and the gyroscope measures the angular velocity of the sensor in three dimensions. By combining the data from these two sensors, it is possible to determine the orientation of the sensor in three-dimensional space.
The MPU-6050 communicates with a microcontroller, such as an Arduino, using an I2C interface. The microcontroller sends commands to the MPU-6050 to configure it and to read the sensor data. The sensor data is then used to calculate the orientation of the object.
